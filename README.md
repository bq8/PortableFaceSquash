# PortableFaceSquash

A simple app to demonstrate how to distort an image using OpenGL ES 2.0 on iOS. The image is disorted by applying a quad over the image and then mapping the quad back to a rectangle. Based on [Face-Squash](https://github.com/bschwind/Face-Squash), an XNA demo created by [@bschwind](https://github.com/bschwind).

# Instructions

Build and run the app using Xcode in either the simulator or a physical device. 

The red handles represent the corners of the image. Moving the handles distorts the image.
